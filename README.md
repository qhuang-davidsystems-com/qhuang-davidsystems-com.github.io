# Chapter Ending

This is a chapter that I should make a summary of, and now it has finally become the time.

I have some beliefs and some principles which have led me from P.R.China to Germany. I has been a little bit more than 3 years and 7 months since I arrived in Germany again in December, 2019. I came with some stories behind.

At the beginning of the year when I was about to graduate from the well-known Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiaotong University, I was a R&D team leader at a startup legal tech company. It was a time when I had to make a choice just like about a year ago when I received an invitation to join the startup. That past year has taught me some lesson and let me grabbed a handful spoon of reality in sociaty in China. I quit, although saying goodbye to a salary which could be regarded as very good, because I had lost my passion and turned not so motivated, and most importantly, I would be very much consumed in a short several years if I didn't choose to leave. I knew, I needed to look further away. I returned full-time at my college preparing my master thesis, started an intership at a head security broker company, and was about to join as a full-time employee with a salary which was much less than I earned for my last job, but I was happy because I did (and do) value the oppotunities and resources the platform could offer me to help myself build a good career for the long-run future. However, with the nationalitiy alike system, Hukou, I made the wrong decision to switch to a startup fin-tech company which has less bureaucracy introduced by my team leader at the security company for timely getting my Shanghai Hukou. I had learned my lesson about how an early startup would likely turn into with my previous job, but I still made the wrong decision by assuming Shanghai Hukou was important to me and ignored thinking deliberately about whether I would stay in Shanghai for long without starting on a good platform. As the result, in the summer of 2018, 5 years ago, I graduated from a top university, joined a fin-tech startup, got my Shanghai Hukou, and most importantly, I picked up my German again after about 3 years of not using German at all since I graduated as a bachelor with the minor in German. 

Looking back, it seems like my destiny to come to Germany. Yes, and it is also more about my plan. I am smart, I see-through a lot, I think a lot, so I confuse a lot. I didn't think clear about where to go after my study of the typical Chinese education path in the summer of 2015 after exchanged in Technical University of Munich, Germany in 2014-2015, graduated as a bachelor in June, 2015, and was about to start my master study. But independence of personality (独立人格) is one of my core value. And I wanted to stay economically independent on my family when some of my bachelor classmates started to earn their lives without continuing a master study. Therefore, I wrote an application to my University of master study for having a gap year to get independent and think more clear about the future. I didn't get approved for the gap year, so I rushed onto the path for my next phase. I started earlist an intership among my master classmates for the desire of independence. I exchanged again in Europe but this time in Sweden, a country I had almost no knowledge about, to check whether I could start a life in a foreign environment. And I also indeeded hesitated when I was invited to join the legal tech startup, because that was also the time when I had to start my serious career path by doing serious interships. I got a yes by asking for a salary taking opportunity cost into account satisfied. I was willing to join, not really just because of the very good salary. There were more aspects. One of them was also that I could gain knowledge and experience in software development which is more internationally universal in comparison to doing interships in big companies of the Chinese financial industry as preparation to join the big which was the choice of almost all of my classmates. After a year, I was almost about to return to the normal track like many of my classmate although with the focus on software development at a big in the Chinese financial industry. But there came the Hukou issue and then I finally picked up my German plan. Worth mentioning, after about another big half of a year, I indeed got another chance to stay at a relatively big mutual fund company with a salary which could even be higher than my first job in the legal tech startup. I joined and left in one week. Because I had already been implementing my German plan and I thought it didn't worth it. What is it? It was mainly about time and about people I would work with therefore grow with. Then I finally got my gap big half of a year, learning German and passing the two parts of the Financial Risk Manager (FRM) exam. And in December, 2019, I came back to Munich, Germany.

I was lucky and unlucky at the same time because of the COVID-19. I was lucky that I left China not long before the outbreak of COVID-19, otherwise, I might not be able to leave, while unlucky that not long after I arrived in Munich, many companies stopped hiring because of COVID-19. I was super confident because I knew well how good I was including how smart I am and how hard I had tried to gain my abilities, but I was also worried. I compromised about the companies and job roles in consideration. And I was also lucky to get hired by my current company. I am very grateful that my current company gave me the chance, although at the time I accepted the offer I indeed had another very likely running offer from a company in the financial industry in Germany, but it was just a hard to tell tiny startup. I liked my current company very much upon joining. It has several aspects I imagined as very necessary for long-term career plan. It has a long history which I thought would also mean well established and refined software development workflow that I benefit a lot from working at it; it focuses on one sector (although not the one I had gained my knowledge) which I thought would also mean knowledge and expertise gained in depth. It is the German engineering culture aspects I favor. So at the night before I joined my current company, I wrote a line like "I wish I could to stay there for more than 7 years" in my long Chinese blog post. Now, it is only a bit more than 3 years, and I have to decide to be leaving, although I haven't yet sent out a single résumé since I joined. Why?

It also comes down to the lose of passion and trust in it. As the chapter is just ending not ended, and even ended, I am still grateful that my current company in fact helpt me settling down in Germany, so there are aspects I could tell and more aspects I may not be able to tell, publicly on the Internet.
