# Chapter Ending

This is a chapter that I need to wirte about, and now it has finally become the time.

I have some beliefs and some principles which have led me from P.R.China to Germany. I has been more 3 years and 7 months since I arrived in Germany again in December, 2019. I came with some stories behind.

At the beginning of the year when I was about to graduate from the well-known Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiaotong University, I was a R&D team supervisor at a startup legal tech company. It was a time when I had to make a choice just like about a year ago when I received an invitation to join the startup. That past year has taught me some lesson and let me grabbed a handful spoon of reality in sociaty in China. I quit, although saying good bye to a salary which could be regards as very good, because I had lost my passion and turned not so motivated, and most importantly, I would be very much consumed in a short several years if I didn't choose to leave. I knew, I needed to look further away. I returned full-time at my college preparing my master thesis, started an intership at a head security broker company, and was about to join as a full-time employee with a salary which was much less than I earned for my last job, but I was happy because I did (and do) value the oppotunities and resources the platform could offer me to help myself build a better career. However, with the nationalitiy alike system, Hukou, I made the wrong decision to switch to a startup fin-tech company which has less bureaucracy introduced by my team leader at the security company for getting my Shanghai Hukou. I had learned my lesson about how a early startup would likely turns into with my previous job, but I made the wrong decision by assuming Shanghai Hukou was important to me and ignored thinking deliberately about the long term plan of staying in Shanghai. As a result, in the summer of 2018, 5 years ago, I graduated from a top university, joined a fin-tech startup, got my Shanghai Hukou, but most importantly, I picked up my German after about 3 years of not using German at all since I graduated as a bachelor with a minor in German.
